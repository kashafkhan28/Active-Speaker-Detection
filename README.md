# Active Speaker Detection

## Overview
Active Speaker Detection is a project aimed at detecting the active speaker in a multi-party conversation or meeting. The primary goal is to automatically identify who is speaking at any given time within a group discussion. This can be particularly useful in various applications such as video conferencing systems, meeting transcription, and accessibility features for the hearing impaired.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: The system is capable of detecting the active speaker in real-time during a conversation or meeting.
- **Multi-party Support**: It can handle scenarios with multiple participants speaking simultaneously.
- **Accuracy**: The system aims for high accuracy in identifying the active speaker, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the number of participants in a conversation without significant performance degradation.
- **Customizable**: The system can be fine-tuned or adapted to specific environments or requirements.
